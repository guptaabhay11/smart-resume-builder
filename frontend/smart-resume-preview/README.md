## Installation

To set up the frontend application locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guptaabhay11/smart-resume-builder
   cd smart-resume-builder
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` should point to your backend API URL.

4. Run the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the frontend is running, you can interact with the UI that communicates with the backend API. Here are the main features:

### Authentication

- **Login**: Users can log in using their registered email and password.
- **Register**: Users can register to create a new account.



## Folder Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the folder structure:

```
/public
  index.html            # Main HTML template
/src
  /assets               # Global assets (e.g., images, styles)
  /components           # Reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, forms)
  /pages                # Page components (e.g., Home, Dashboard)
  /redux                # Redux slices for managing state
  /services             # API calls and business logic
  /styles               # Global CSS or SCSS files
  App.js                # Main app component
  index.js              # Entry point
  setupTests.js         # Test setup
  .env                  # Environment variables
```

### `/src/components`

Contains reusable UI components, like buttons, inputs, and form elements.

### `/src/pages`

Contains the page components for different sections of the app, such as the dashboard, login, and registration pages.

### `/src/store`

Contains Redux slices for managing global state, including user authentication, personal information, education, experience, and cover letters.

### `/src/services`

Handles API communication with the backend, making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the backend API.

### `/src/styles`

Contains global CSS or SCSS files for styling the application.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variable is required:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: URL of the backend API (for development, it should be set to `http://localhost:8080`).

## API Endpoints

The frontend interacts with the following backend API endpoints:

### Authentication

- **POST** `/auth/register` – Registers a new user.
- **POST** `/auth/login` – Logs in a user and returns a JWT token.

### Personal Info

- **GET** `/personal-info` – Fetch all personal information for the logged-in user.
- **POST** `/personal-info` – Create or update the user's personal information.
- **PATCH** `/personal-info/:id` – Update personal information.
- **DELETE** `/personal-info/:id` – Delete personal information.

### Education

- **GET** `/education` – Fetch all education records.
- **POST** `/education` – Add a new education record.
- **PATCH** `/education/:id` – Update an existing education record.
- **DELETE** `/education/:id` – Delete an education record.

### Experience

- **GET** `/experience` – Fetch all experience records.
- **POST** `/experience` – Add a new experience record.
- **PATCH** `/experience/:id` – Update an experience record.
- **DELETE** `/experience/:id` – Delete an experience record.


## Running the Application

### Running the Frontend

Once you’ve set up the backend and frontend as described above, run the frontend with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the frontend application at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running the Backend (Optional)

To run the backend, follow the instructions in the backend `README.md` and ensure that your backend API is running on the specified URL (default is `http://localhost:8080`).

### Testing the Application

You can write tests for components, Redux actions, and reducers using libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library.
