## Authentication

The application uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication.

1. **Register** a new user by sending a `POST` request to `/auth/register`.
2. **Login** an existing user by sending a `POST` request to `/auth/login`. This will return a JWT that must be included in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.
3. **Role-based Authentication**: Only users with the `ADMIN` role can access certain endpoints (e.g., fetching all education records).

## Environment Variables

Below is a list of environment variables used in the application:

- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
